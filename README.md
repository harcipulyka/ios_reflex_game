# Simple iOS reflex game - my first XCode project
A simple game that tests your reflexes and lets you compare it to other's.

## First mode
There is only two colors on the screen, and the player has to press the different colored one always. After hitting 25 tiles, it shows the player their score and the leaderboard. Each missed click adds to the time, and the goal is to click on the 25 tiles as fast as possible.

## Second mode
With the mode switch button the player can switch to the second mode, he/she has to press the tiles that has the same color as the background. As both the background's color, and every tiles' color change after every click, this is harder and slower.
